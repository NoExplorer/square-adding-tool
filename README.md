# square-adding-tool
A project that aims the automation of [Cocoatwix's](https://github.com/Cocoatwix) [Square Adding](https://yewtu.be/watch?v=hGQdsibB2is) concept. <p>&nbsp;</p>
# Installing or building
**Simple way**
1. Click on `Code`
2. Click `Download ZIP`
3. Extract the archive with your favourite archive manager <!-- -->

**`git clone`**
1. Open a terminal (or Command Promt in Windows) window
2. Type `git clone https://github.com/NoExplorer/square-adding-tool` and press enter.
3. Open the `square-adding-tool` folder, wherever it saved. (Usually `/home/` in Linux, and MacOS maybe) <!-- -->

After all that, just open the `.py` file in your preferred code editor. No real installation is needed.<p>&nbsp;</p>
# If you wish to contribute..
..here's what you can do to make this program a little cooler:
- Translate the `DOCUMENTATION.MD` and/or `README.MD` file to your native language <!-- -->

or

- Introduce new features, optimize the code (while keeping it readable) or fix a bug or two. **BUT** make sure it doesn't depend on internet functionality, I want this app to be completely offline. Also it keeps things simple too.<p>&nbsp;</p>
# Contributions
Here are some of the people who either fixed (my spaghetti code) or introduced cool new features:
- **[JZGonzales](https://github.com/JZGonzales)** on 30th of June 2022 : *[floating point delay in generateNumber_ALL](https://github.com/NoExplorer/square-adding-tool/pull/1)* <p>&nbsp;</p>
# Future plans
My next thing for this, thing, is to make it a GUI app instead of a CLI. I'll still keep the CLI version available, so if you are that guy you should be OK. After that, there might be an AUR (Arch User Repository) package release, maybe standalone packages for Windows and such, but that might be useless.
